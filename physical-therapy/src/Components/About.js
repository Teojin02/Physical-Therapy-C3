            C3 stands for my name, Clarissa Carino Celestino.
            I am a passionate physical therapist from the Philippines.

            I graduated from Our Lady of Fatima University in 1997 with BS Physical Therapy. 
            I worked as a home health PT  in the Philippines from 1997 to 2009. 
            Most of my patients were stroke patients, patients with chronic pain and orthopedics.  
            I was sponsored by Mountainland/ Brighton Rehab to immigrate to the US with my husband, Teo  and son, 
            Teojin and  transitioned to Salt Lake City, Utah in November 2009. 
            I worked at Avalon Healthcare facilities with geriatric community until September 2019. 
            My main building was Avalon West Health and Rehab in Taylorsville, Utah.

            My passion is to work with neuro patients, help them maximize their potentials and return them to their home by being able to take care of themselves. 
            I feel rewarded to send a patient home after staying in our building for months after CVA, brain or spinal cord injuries. 
            And I feel great to share my skills so the said patient above will be independent in mobility, 
            be it with or without a walker or a wheelchair.
            <br></br>

I am a believer of the science behind neuroplasticity and how  electrotherapy can help return  motor function.  I have seen great results in my practice. The latest breakthroughs in dry needling is also very promising in managing spasticity.
In December 2019, 
I transitioned as a travel physical therapist in Tucson, Arizona.
 Great opportunity was granted to me to be part of Banner Physical Therapy in March 2020 to serve the cancer survivors through ReVital program.
ReVital program is offering a comprehensive rehabilitation and  support  to cancer survivorship.
